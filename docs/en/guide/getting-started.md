# Getting Started

## Installation

You can get Twig.js by any of the following methods:

### Git:



1.  Clone the repository

`git clone git://github.com/justjohn/twig.js.git`

2. Download an archive of the latest as a [zip](https://github.com/justjohn/twig.js/zipball/master) or [tgz](https://github.com/justjohn/twig.js/tarball/master)

The files `twig.js` and `twig.min.js` may not be up-to-date (they will be rebuilt when releasing a new version). Run `make` (or `make -B` to force building) to create these files.

### NPM:

```bash
npm install twig --save-dev
```

### Yarn:

```bash
yarn add twig --dev
```
