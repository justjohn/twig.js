# What is Twig.js?

Twig.js is a pure JavaScript implementation of the [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/) PHP templating language

The goal is to provide a library that is compatible with both browsers and server side containers such as node.js.

Twig.js is currently a work in progress and supports a limited subset of the Twig templating language (with more coming).

## NEWS

- 6/10/2016 - Twig is now available as a template engine in [Keystone.js](http://keystonejs.com/)

## Implementation Details

See the [implementation details](/reference/implementation-notes) page for a list of supported filters/functions/tags/tests.
